# not_a_database


Lets be clear, this is not a database!
 It is, however, attempting to replicate the actions of a database.

## Files.

    database.py
    db_interface.py
    data.csv

To run this program put "python3 db_interface.py" in your terminal. This will allow user interaction with the data file, but only with a valid password and username.
